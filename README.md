# scripts
Scripts used by me during my time at IIT-D.
## pyq_downloader
downloads all the pyq's for a particular course from the BSW official site. Can be tuned to do the same from some other site. Any updates are welcome.
## CourseScrapper
Can be used to find which Professor took which course in which year.
## student_data
Who took which course in the current semester.
## NSS
Scraps the NSS hours of all the students based on their website. Need updates to handle the app properly.
